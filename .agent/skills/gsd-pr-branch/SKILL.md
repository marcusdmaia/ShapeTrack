description: "Cria uma branch de PR limpa filtrando commits do .planning/ — pronta para revisão de código"

<objective>
Create a clean branch suitable for pull requests by filtering out .planning/ commits
from the current branch. Reviewers see only code changes, not GSD planning artifacts.

This solves the problem of PR diffs being cluttered with PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, STATE.md
changes that are irrelevant to code review.
